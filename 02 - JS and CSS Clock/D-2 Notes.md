1. transform: rotate
rotates on the middle part but what we need is to rotate from the end

we use the transform-origin
> transform-origin: x-axis y-axis z-axis;
along the x-axis we set 100%


2. [getDate()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp)


3. setInterval()
calls the function at intervals 
> setInterval(<function>, <milliseconds>);

1 second = 1000 milliseconds

can be stopped with clearInterval() or when window is closed 


4. glitch when a cycle ends 
fixed by temporarily removing the transition

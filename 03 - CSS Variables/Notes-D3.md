1. NodeList vs Array

Array - has methods 
NodeList - has limited methods


2. data attributes

data attributes are just made up
to make one you just (fix it) with data- + suffix 

in this exercise we used the data-sizing="px" for spacing and blur. it's used for specifying their units on the setproperty. the base color requires a hexcode value and has no need for units so it has no data-sizing attribute.  

3. dataset

will get all the data atrributes of that specific element 
will get all data-___ on the element and put it on an object. you'll get to access the properties by referring to the dataset object. 

4. setproperty 
> object.setProperty(propertyname, value, priority)


5. change and mousemove event

in this context, change and mousemove event are both needed
change - to reflect changes immediately onclick
mousemove - to reflect changes immediately while on drag

1. fetch API 
    * will return a '[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)' 
    * .then() returns a blob of data 

    blob has to be converted from raw data into JSON 

2. const vs let vs var 
    * Reminds me of their difference in delcaring an identifier 
    * both let and const are block scoped 
    * var is function scoped; undefined by the default
    * const can't be reassigned, but you can mutate the value of its properties. 
    * it's also best practice to use const when you know you won't be changing its value 

3. ...spread ES6
    * spread into a function 

4. regex
    * formatting

5. join('')
    * array from multiple items to one big string
